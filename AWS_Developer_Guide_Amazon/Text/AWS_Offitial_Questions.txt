2.- When you make API calls to AWS services, for most services those requests are directed at a specific endpoint that corresponds to which of the following?

3.- When you're configuring a local development machine to make AWS API calls, with of the following is the simplest secure method of obtaining an API credential?

5.- You have a team member who needs access to write records to an existing Amazon DynamoDB table within your account. How might you grant write permission to this specific table and only this table?

6.- You created a Movies DynamoDB table in the AWS Management Console, but when you try to list your DynamoDB tables by using the Java SDK, you do not see this table. Why?

7.- You make an API request to describe voices offered by Amazon Polly by using the AWS CLI, and you receive the following error message:
Could not connect to the endpoint URL:
https://polly.us-east-1a.amazonaws.com/v1/voices
What went wrong?

8.- To what resource does this IAM policy grant access, and for which actions?
{
	"Version":"2012-10-17",
	"Statement": {
		"Effect":"Allow",
		"Action":"s3.ListBucket",
		"Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::example_bucket"
	}
}

9.- When an IAM user makes an API call, that user's long-term credentials are valid in which context?

10.- When you use identity federation to assume a role, where are the credentials you use to make AWS API calls generated?

11.- You have an on-premises application that needs to sample data from all your Amazon DynamoDB tables. You have defined an IAM user for your application called TableAuditor. How can you give the TableAuditor user read access to new DynamoDB tables as soon they are created in your account?

12.- The principals who have access to assume an IAM role are defined in which document?

13.- A new developer has joined your small team. You would like to help your team member set up a development computer for access to the team account quickly and securely. How do you proceed?

14.- You have been working with the Amazon Polly service in your application by using the Python SDK for Linux. You are building a second application in C#, and you would like to run that application on a separate Windows Server with .NET. How can you proceed?

15.- You are a Virginia-based company, and you have been asked to implement a custom application exclusively for customers in Australia. This application has no dependencies on any of your existing applications. What is a method you use to keep the customer latency to this new application low?
