6.- (Optional) Modify the Python code to use a different voice. See Exercise 1.3 for an AWS CLI command that provides the list of available voices.

You hear "Hello World" when you play the generated audio file. If you completed the optional challenge, you also hear the audio spoken in a different voice from the first audio.

Exercise 1.6
Working with Multiple regions

In this exercise, you'll use Amazon Polly to understand the effects of working with different AWS Regions.

1.- Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder with the book sample code.
2.- Navigate to chapter-01 in the folder where you downloaded the sample code.
3.- Verify that the region is us-east-1 by running the following command: 
aws configure get region
4.- Upload aws-lexicon.xml to th Amazon Polly service in the default region, which is US East (N. Virginia). 
aws polly put-lexicon --name awsLexicon --content file://aws-lexicon.xml
5.- The file helloaws.py is currently overriding the region to be EU (London). Run the Python code and observe the LexiconNotFoundException that returns. 
python helloaws.py
6.- Upload the lexicon to EU (London) by setting the region to eu-west-2. 
aws polly put-lexicon --name awsLexicon --content file://aws-lexicon.xml --region eu-west-2
7.- Run the following Python script again: python helloaws.py 
Observe that it executes successfully this time and generate an MP3 file in the current folder.
8.- Play the generated helloaws.mp3 file to confirm that it says, "Hello Amazon Web Services".
9.- (Optional) Delete the lexicons with the following commands: 
aws polly delete-lexicon --name awsLexicon
aws polly delete-lexicon --name awsLexicon --region eu-west-2

Even though the text supplied by the API call to synthesize speech was "Hello AWS!", the generated audio file uses the lexicon you uploaded to pronounce it as "Hello Amazon Web Services".

Exercise 1.7
Working with additional profiles

In this exercise, you difine a limited user for the account and configure a new profile in the SDK to use these credentials. Notice that the permissions are restrivtive and that you need to update the permissions for that user to be more permissive.

*AWS Access Key ID: Copy the value from the CSV you downloaded.
*AWS Secret Access Key: Copy the value from the CSV you downloaded.
*Default region name: Enter us-east-1.
*Default output format: Press Enter to retain the default setting.
22.- Upload the lexicon.
The upload operation is expected to fail beacuse of the restricted permissions associated with the profile specified in the script. Run the following Python script: 
python upload-restricted.py
23.- Return to the AWS Management Console for IAM, and in the left navigarion, select Users.
24.- To view a user summary page, select DevRestricted user.
25.- Choose Add permissions.

In this exercise, you will explore connectivity to he private instance.

1.- From your web browser, navigate to the private IP of the instances. Though the security group is open to requests from anywhere, this will fail beacuse the private IP address is not routable over the internet.
2.- Select Services > EC2.
3.- From the list of instances, select webserver.
4.- Select Connect and then follow the directions to establish an SSH connection.
5.- From within the SSH session, make an HTTP request to the private server with curl. Replace the variable private-ip-address with the private IP address of provate-instance address that you copied earlier. curl private-ip-address
6.- Download the MP3 audio from the private instance to webserver using curl as follows: curl provate-ip-address/instance.mp3 --output instance.mp3
7.- Make the file available for download from webserver: sudo cp instance.mpe /var/www/html/instance.mp3
8.- In your web browser, enter the following address. Subtitute public-ip-of-webserver with the public IPv4 address of webserver, and listen to the MP3. https://public-ip-of-webserver/instance.mp3

Though the private web server is not reachable from the internet, you have confirmed that it is reachable to other instances within the same Amazon VPC. As part of the bootstrapping, the private instance made AWS API calls, which require the ability to make both web request via the NAT gateway and credentials from an IAM role. You have confirmed that these request succeeded by downloading the resulting MP3 file from private-instance and placing it on webserver.

Exercise 2.9
Launch an AWS Cloud9 Instance

In this exercise, you'll launch an Amazon EC2 instance that you will create in the AWS Cloud9 service. You will connect to this Amazon EC2 instance from the AWS Cloud9 console.

Exercise 3.1

Create an Amazon Simple storage Service (Amazon S3) Bucket

In this exercise, you will create an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for Java. You will use this bucket in the exercises that follow.

For assistance in completing this exercise, copying this code, of for code in other languages, see the following documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/lastestdev/create-bucket-get-location-example.html

1.- Enter the following code in your preferred development environment for Java:
...

2.- Replace the static variable values for clientRegion and bucketName. Note that bucket names must be unique across all of AWS. Make anote of these two values; you will use the same region and bucket name for the exercises that follow in this chapter.

3.- Execute the code. Your bucket gets created with the name you specified in the region you specified. A successful result shows the following oputput:

Bucket Location: [bucketLocation]

Exercise 3.2

Upload an Object to a Bucket

Now that you have a bucket, you can add objects to it. In this example, you will create two objects. The first object has a text string as data, and the second object is a file. This example creates the first object is a file. This example creates the first object by specifying the bucket name, object key, and text data directly in a call to AmazonS3Client.putObject(). The oecample creates a second object by using a PutObjectRequest that specifies the bucket name, object key, and file path. The PutObjectRequest also specifies the ContentType header and title metadata.

For assistance in completing this exercise, coping this code, or for code in other languages, see the following documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadObjSingleOpJava.html

1.- Enter the following code in your preferred development environment for Java:
...

2.- Repalce the static variable values for clientRegion and bucketName used in the previous exercise.
